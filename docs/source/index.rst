``labscript`` documentation
===========================
``labscript``, a component of the labscript suite, is an API used to define the experiment logic of a buffered experiment shot. This documentation will outline the general device hierarchy used when defining a connection table, and the ``labscript`` classes used to command input and output. For device specific documentation, and documentation for adding support for new devices, please refer to the ``labscript_devices`` documentation.
